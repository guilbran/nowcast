\title{nowcasting and create Real-Time data basis}
\description{
This package is an initiative of the Center for Statistical and Computational Methods (NMEC) belonging to the Brazilian Institute of Economics (IBRE) of the Get√∫lio Vargas Foundation (FGV). Our goal is to develop a real-time predictive measure of Brazilian GDP that helps IBRE researchers in their analysis about the Brazilian economy.

The purpose of this package is to disseminate to the community of \code{R} users the statistical tools and techniques of 'nowcast' already known in the academic literature. One can find in this package a simple and practical way to reproduce several of these techniques for their studies.

In this preliminary version of the package we present only one method, based on a seminal article in this literature:
\emph{Giannone, Domenico, Lucrezia Reichlin, and David Small. "Nowcasting: The real-time informational content of macroeconomic data." Journal of Monetary Economics 55.4 (2008): 665-676.}
This is one of the seminal works in the nowcasting area. Some functions are adaptations and translations of this paper's \emph{replication files} avaible in MATLAB and RATS. One can found these \emph{replication files} in the following url:
